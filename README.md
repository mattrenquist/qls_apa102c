# qls_apa102c

This package provides a hardware driver for the [sparkfun Qwiic LED Stick - APA102C](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18354) that can be used together with [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org).

## Notes

* This code has only been tested with the [SparkFun Thing Plus - RP2040](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17745), though it should work with any other board supported by [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org).
* Code structure was modeled after the drivers in the [tinygo-org/drivers](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers) repo.
* Registers and function names were modeled after the [SparkFun Qwiic LED Stick Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_LED_Stick_Arduino_Library).
